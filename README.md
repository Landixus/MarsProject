Project M.A.R.S. is an arcade racing game set on the surface of Mars in the near future, when humanity has reached the red planet and is beginning its colonization. The player will need to complete missions concerning transport, research and exploration, all while driving racing cars built with the new "Martian Advandced Racing System".
 
 
 
 ## Project Features
 
This project is [made with Unity](https://unity3d.com/), and the source code is written in C#. Among the main features of the game we count the physics management (Martian reduced gravity, dynamic vehicle adherence depending on different types of surface), the dynamic management of the vehicle assembly in the dedicated garage, and the entire camera system.
All these feature were manually coded by the game programmers in the team.

## Showcase Garage

The garage is one of the main features of the game. Inside the garage the player can personalize his vehicle, and every component has his pros and cons. For exemple some engines are faster but heavier, some wheels have better adherence but they're slover and so on. So the player needs to choose wisely the car components before because every terrains in the game are different.
